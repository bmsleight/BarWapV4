I love the concept of [Brython](http://brython.info/) a Python 3 implementation for client-side web programming. 

I have made a quick [blocks game](https://bmsleight.github.io/brython-blocks/) which runs in the browser, - written not in Javascript but [in Python](https://github.com/bmsleight/brython-blocks/blob/master/blocks.py). 

[Blocks Game - https://bmsleight.github.io/brython-blocks/](https://bmsleight.github.io/brython-blocks/) and [code - https://github.com/bmsleight/brython-blocks](https://github.com/bmsleight/brython-blocks) is on GiHub. I used for the css side [mincss](https://mincss.com/)
