I need need to build my projects away from the loft. Time to build a man-cave.

#### Pre-work

Got the old shed removed (and the junk - thanks http://kgwastedisposal.com/). Did some industrial espionage and pricing on other Shed.  Worked out that cost for a pre-built basic shed in a similar size,  would equal how I wanted  in terms of size,  thermal isolation and power supply - if I design & built myself.

#### Step 1 - OpenSCAD
The first step was to build a [model in OpenScad](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed/blob/master/shedshedshed.scad), after a couple of [iterations](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed) we got to a final version that should fit in to the space.  The advantage of modelling the shed in OpenSCAD is that I can 3D-Print some useful parts.

#### Printed Scaled-down Shed
The first useful part I can print is a model of the shed its self.

This allows me to play with the sizes, shape and look of the shed pre-build.  I can also see how it would look in the garden (sort-of).
