I need need to build my projects away from the loft. Time to build a man-cave.

#### Pre-work

Got the old shed removed (and the junk - thanks http://kgwastedisposal.com/). Did some industrial espionage and pricing on other Shed. [Local shed shop; google maps ](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.409949,-0.1621097,3a,75y,256.25h,97.19t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sCg0LKZJ5p0WS83GfPUmWKg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).  Worked out that cost  ([~Â£1,500 Pent Style](http://www.the-shed-centre.co.uk/product_addbasket.asp?pid=214&Submit=Go) ) for a pre-built basic shed which is too long and thin. I wanted 17 feet by 6.5 feet not 18 feet by 6 feet.  My rough estimates for a similar size, with good thermal isolation and power supply would be cheaper - if I design & built myself.

#### Step 1 - OpenSCAD
The first step was to build a [model in OpenScad](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed/blob/master/shedshedshed.scad), after a couple of [iterations](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed) we got to a final version that should fit in to the space.  The advantage of modelling the shed in OpenSCAD is that I can 3D-Print some useful parts.

#### Printed Scaled-down Shed
The first useful part I can print is a model of the shed its self.

This allows me to play with the sizes, shape and look of the shed pre-build.  I can also see how it would look in the garden (sort-of).
