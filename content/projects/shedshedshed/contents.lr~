### Printed Parts
Lots of opportunities to use my skills in 3D printing. Models, brackets, roof decorations inlcuding links to the stl files.

#### Step 1 - OpenSCAD
The first step was to build a [model in OpenScad](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed/blob/master/shedshedshed.scad), after a couple of [iterations](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed) we got to a final version that should fit in to the space.  The advantage of modelling the shed in OpenSCAD is that I can 3D-Print some useful parts.

#### Printed Scaled-down Shed
The first useful part I can print is a model of the shed its self.

This allows me to play with the sizes, shape and look of the shed pre-build.  I can also see how it would look in the garden (sort-of).

#### Printed Parts
The first item is a [wedge](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed/blob/master/wedge.scad) that is the exact angle needed for the roof beam. This can be screwed on to a piece of timber using the two wings. Which then gives suitable points to drill and install screw for connecting the roof to the frame. Also OpenSCAD makes it easy to [design](https://github.com/bmsleight/shedshed/blob/master/hole_template.scad) and print a hole template for the timber. This makes it easy for me to drill holes for the screws. The last item is a simple joint to keep the timber stud work square.

#### Step 2 - Mark & Step Up Camera
The next step (apart from removing the old shed, clearing the area and removing rubbish), is to mark out the footprint of the Shed. Then set-up a camera to use as a time-lapse camera.

#### Costs 
The cost for a custom build shed of 16 feet x 6 feet (4.88 x 1.83m) is around £1,500. This is smaller than the available space, but biggest available. I am aiming for  5.18 x 1.98m.  The £1,500 will get me a shed, I am after a timber building - with insulation and other nice things, but still within a tight budget.

One way to reduce costs is to hit eBay
