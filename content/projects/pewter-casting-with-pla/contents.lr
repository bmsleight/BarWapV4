I was having trouble with High Temperature Silicone Mould making kit. With some left over liquid pewter - I just poured it into a PLA mold and it did not just melt. With this in mind I experimented.... After some work I now have got this as a workable method for producing metal objects.   

The video on the left walks you through the process - a [longer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6n36CaY1V8) details each step in more detail.

Assuming you have a 3D-Printer (doesnâ€™t everyone ?) , if you invest a few pounds for a ebay-toaster-oven and some lead-free pewter make you own metal objects. Anything from Christmas Broaches to lovely cufflinks.  Other [projects feature cufflinks](/projects/cuffelinks/) - I just like them,
