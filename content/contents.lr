boxblurb: A collection of some of my hobby projects, anything from building a Bed Bus, 3d Printing to traffic light cufflinks. Just space to store references and links and I am getting too old to blog. [Blogging is for the early naughties.](http://web.archive.org/web/20050312171037/http://barwap.com/blog/?article=1])
